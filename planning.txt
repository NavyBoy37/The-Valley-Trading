Long term GOOD gameplay idea
-unlockable regions based on completing one large unique task for a deity
-Money from trading is required to get materials/unlock necessary avenues to completing unique objective.
-As well as regions, unique upgrades to equipment are given with the completion of each region.


Gameplay Ideas
-Guilds or known associates who can give quests or have special offerings.  With relationships like stardew valley.
-Property that can be purchased that generates income, or warehouses for storage and things like that
-Upgrades to cart for weight or horses for speed
-Add seasons and season specific events

Items to balance
-supplies used in travel (distance of roads)
-Storage of cart
-Weight and supply of goods


About the Protagonist:
"  Instead of the player role playing a unique individual, the player will be guiding someone who already has a story,
but the story will be slowly revealed over the course of the game.  You learn more about the protagonist and you want to learn more as you go."



The main mover of price will be supply in one town relative to another.

Products
    -Iron Ore
    -Corn

Variables to consider
    -Price normalization over time.  
    This is the tendency for differing prices in towns to slowly converge to one price across the board.  This is assumed to be because of arbitrage business transactions like trading.  
    This is meant to be a slow process which can be easily outran by traveling to and from locations.  
    The real mover of markets is going to be supply side, which is a different matter to consider.
    -City initializations need to consider distance relative to one another in their calulations.  Maybe price normalization can be stronger the closer cities are together.
    -On DISTANCE again, maybe it could be measured in days of journeying by different roads.  A flat calculation doesn't really make much sense if there are multiple ways to get there.
    Maybe a more elaborate route planner is necessary.

Supply Variables
    -Jobs(industry specific.  This opens the door for meta data regarding wages for transferrable skills.  Iron and Coal miners are similar and might share a workforce.)
    -Workers

We'll use numbers in the code, but the translation at the end in the UI will be 10 for 1 copper, 100 for 1 silver, and 1000 for 1 gold piece.
This makes the exchange rate 100 copper -> 1 silver and 10 silver -> 1 gold.  A bit odd but I think I'm okay with it.

BASIC PRICING LOGIC
the Price_Calculator and Map_Total_Supply functions provide this.
Map_Total_Supply finds the total quantity of one product
Price_Calculator calculates the Market Cap of a certain product using the base price and total amount.  Market cap is then divided by each cities individual stockpiles.
Obviously this is not how real markets function because it assumes equal demand across all the cities.  It provides somewhat realistic numbers to start with.  I intend to alter them later with other variables.
